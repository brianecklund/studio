- Accent color: Soft violet (#8A2BE2) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headers, to give a geometric, modern look, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body, to improve readability of longer texts.
- Use minimalist icons to represent asset types and project status.
- Implement a clear, card-based layout for asset and project visualization.
- Incorporate subtle transition animations for project updates and feedback submissions.
